        <p>
          I am a software developer with over three years of experience,
          specializing in backend development. I have worked on significant
          projects using technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, and
          I have experience implementing microservices, hexagonal architecture,
          and domain-driven design (DDD). Additionally, I am proficient with
          modern tools and technologies like Apache Kafka, Docker, and AWS,
          which enable me to build efficient and scalable applications. I am
          passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends in backend
          development and continuously enhancing my skills to deliver innovative
          and high-quality solutions.
